# NLP Text Summarizer
A hybrid approach to text summarization using both extractive TextRank and abstractive PEGASUS models .

This project combines two powerful techniques in NLP:

 - **TextRank** : Selects important sentences from the original text.
 - **PEGASUS**  : Generates new, concise summaries using deep learning.

Here's what the output looks like:

### Top Sentences:
- "Deep learning algorithms are typically trained on large datasets..."
- "Deep learning works by using artificial neural networks..."

### Top Phrases:
- deep learning
- neural networks
- image recognition

### Abstractive Summary:
"Deep learning uses neural networks trained on labeled datasets to perform tasks like image and speech recognition."
